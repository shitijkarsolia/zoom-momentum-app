# Zoom Momentum — Project Status

Last updated: April 7, 2026

## Current State

The app builds, runs locally, and **loads inside a real Zoom meeting**. All core features are code-complete. RTMS live transcription tested and working. **Host↔student messaging now works via WebSocket relay.** AI backend uses CREATE AI (gemini-pro → claude-3-opus) with Bedrock fallback. Demo mode auto-enables outside Zoom for browser testing.

### Resolved Blockers

1. ~~**SDK Config Timeout**~~ — Fixed. Use `window.zoomSdk` from CDN, not npm import.
2. ~~**Mock Transcript FK Bug**~~ — Fixed. `transcript.ts` uses `meeting-resolver` + upsert.
3. ~~**Host↔Student Messaging**~~ — Fixed. Replaced Zoom SDK `postMessage`/`onMessage` with WebSocket relay through Express. SDK messaging was designed for same-user instances only.

## Known Bugs

1. ~~**[Critical] SDK config timeout**~~ — FIXED.
2. ~~**[Critical] Messaging broken**~~ — FIXED. WebSocket relay.
3. **[Medium] Multiple PrismaClient instances** — transcript.ts, bookmarks.ts, auth.ts, rtms-ingest.ts, meeting-resolver.ts each create their own. Should be singleton.
4. **[Medium] AI topic-segment silent failure** — `ai.ts` returns a fake success response when the AI call fails.
5. **[Medium] Anchor topic dedup** — AI sometimes generates slightly different titles for the same topic.
6. ~~**[Low] RTMS secret fallback**~~ — FIXED.
7. **[Low] BigInt serialization** — `transcript.ts` returns segments without converting BigInt fields to strings.
8. **[Low] Startup race** — mock-transcript chunk #1 always fails with ECONNREFUSED.
9. **[Low] Participant count** — Hardcoded "Participants: --" in host UI.
10. **[Low] Sign-in button** — Does nothing on participant side in Zoom context.
11. ~~**[Low] "Analyze Now" button**~~ — FIXED. Removed.

## What's Left

### Priority 0 — DONE
- ~~Switch messaging to WebSocket relay~~ — DONE. Server relay + client rewrite.
- ~~RTMS integration~~ — DONE. Start AI triggers `startRTMS()`, live-tested.
- ~~Demo mode~~ — DONE. Auto-enabled outside Zoom, DevPreview removed.

### Priority 1 — End-to-End in Zoom
- Test all features inside a real Zoom meeting (host + student) with WebSocket messaging
- ~~Test RTMS with live transcription~~ — DONE
- Test guest mode with second Zoom account

### Priority 2 — Code Quality
- Create shared PrismaClient singleton
- Fix BigInt serialization in transcript route
- Fix AI silent failure in topic-segment
- Improve anchor topic dedup (fuzzy matching)
- Wire participant count to `getMeetingParticipants()`
- Add test framework (Vitest)
- Add linter (ESLint)

### Priority 3 — Production
- PostgreSQL setup (replace SQLite)
- HTTPS on EC2 (Let's Encrypt)
- Persistent session store (Redis or DB-backed)
- Point Zoom Marketplace URLs to EC2 domain
- Transcript buffer cleanup for long meetings
- CI/CD pipeline

---

## Infrastructure

### EC2
- Instance running with DCV remote desktop
- IAM role: `zoom-momentum-ec2-role` (account `741448917297`)
- S3 + Bedrock invoke access

### AI (AWS Bedrock)
- Region: `us-east-1`
- Current model: `meta.llama3-70b-instruct-v1:0` (Llama 3 70B via Converse API)
- Also available: `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0`, `us.anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`
- Cross-region inference profile IDs required (us. prefix)
- Budget guard: $100/month Bedrock spend limit with auto-deny

### Zoom Marketplace
- App ID: `e2Tvu18-QVug7tGJm7LMWg`
- Client ID: `BKOHt7vISimMYkz_2ML7Q`
- App type: General app, User-managed, Development mode
- Static ngrok domain: `your-tunnel.ngrok-free.dev`
- All Marketplace URLs must match the static domain (Home URL, OAuth redirect, Domain Allow List, RTMS webhook)
- 250 SDK APIs selected in Marketplace
- Second Zoom account added as member of same org for testing

### Dev Setup
```bash
# For Zoom testing (production build):
npm run build -w client
ngrok http 3001 --url=your-tunnel.ngrok-free.dev
npm run dev -w server
npm run dev -w mock-transcript  # optional, for transcript data

# For browser testing (DevPreview):
npm run dev:mock   # client + server + mock transcript
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

## Changelog

### April 6-7, 2026
- **SDK config timeout FIXED** — Root cause: npm `@zoom/appssdk` creates separate instance without native bridge. Switched all hooks to `window.zoomSdk` from CDN script tag.
- **Server serves production build** — Express serves `client/dist` + API on port 3001. Ngrok tunnels to 3001.
- **Messaging debugging** — Confirmed `connect()`, `onConnect`, `postMessage` all work. `onMessage` never fires. Arlo reference app uses WebSockets instead of SDK messaging.
- Fixed mock transcript FK bug — transcript.ts uses meeting-resolver + upsert
- Fixed useLiveAnchor missing meetingId param and wrong response field
- Switched mock transcript from 16 hardcoded math chunks to real CS50 Lecture 0 (700 chunks from Harvard CDN)
- UI/UX overhaul:
  - Poll auto-dismisses 2s after student submits, results fade in/out after 8s
  - Arena: 10s timer, auto-advance (timer → leaderboard → next question), question preview/edit, tailor input, host navigation
  - New BookmarkList component (expandable with metadata)
  - Renamed "I'm Confused" to "Mark for Review"
  - New Transcript tab for students (topic headers, glossary highlighting, auto-scroll)
  - Separate end-class views (host: stats, student: recovery pack)
- Improved AI topic-segment prompt for specific, study-worthy content
- Fixed duplicate topics in anchor (title-based dedup)
- DevPreview wired to real CS50 transcript for Arena, Anchor, and Transcript
- Consolidated docs: STATUS.md, merged spec docs, removed old update files
- Removed all zoom.shitijmathur.tech references
