# Zoom Momentum

A Zoom Apps SDK application that transforms passive virtual classrooms into active learning environments. Momentum runs as an in-meeting side panel, giving professors real-time engagement tools and giving students a dynamic topic timeline, glossary, and post-class review.

---

## How It Works

Zoom Momentum is a **single app** installed once on the Zoom Marketplace. When a participant opens it from the Apps panel during a meeting, the app detects their role automatically:

- **Host / Co-host** sees the **Host Dashboard** with controls to launch polls, start trivia games, and monitor the AI-powered live anchor.
- **Participants** see the **Student View** with a topic timeline, glossary, bookmark button, and receive polls/trivia from the host in real time.

Both views are served from the same URL. The Zoom SDK provides the user's role via `getUserContext()`, and the app renders the appropriate interface. There is no separate installation for students vs. professors — it is one app, one URL, role-aware.

### User Flow

```
Meeting starts
  -> Professor opens Momentum from the Zoom Apps panel
  -> OAuth login (first time only)
  -> Welcome screen (role-specific feature overview)
  -> Host Dashboard appears

Students open Momentum from the Zoom Apps panel
  -> OAuth login (first time only)
  -> Welcome screen (student feature overview)
  -> Student View appears
  -> Students automatically receive polls, trivia, and topic updates from the host
```

## Features

### Professor's Pulse (Host only)

Check-in polls that let the professor gauge student understanding at any point during the lecture.

- Enter optional context (e.g., "We just covered supply and demand")
- AI generates a relevant multiple-choice question
- Professor previews and can edit before launching
- Students see a modal overlay, select an answer, and submit
- Professor ends the poll and results are shown to everyone as a bar chart

### Warm-Up Arena (Host launches, students participate)

A timed trivia game for reviewing material at the start of class.

- Professor enters a topic and AI generates 5 quiz questions
- Each question has a 15-second countdown timer
- Students answer in real time and are scored (base points + speed bonus)
- Leaderboard updates after each question
- Final standings shown at the end

### Live Anchor (Automatic for all participants)

AI-powered real-time topic timeline and glossary built from the live lecture transcript.

- Host activates the AI analysis, which polls the transcript buffer every 30 seconds
- When the AI detects a topic change, a new topic card appears with bullet-point takeaways
- Technical terms and definitions are extracted into a searchable glossary
- Students see the same timeline and can switch between Timeline and Glossary tabs

### Recovery Agent (Post-class, student-facing)

Personalized post-class review based on moments the student bookmarked during the lecture.

- During the lecture, students can tap "I'm Confused" to bookmark the current topic
- When the class ends, the app generates a Recovery Pack with:
  - Plain-language explanation of each confusing topic
  - A practice problem
  - A suggested external resource
- A summary screen shows topics covered, key terms, and the recovery pack

## Host vs. Student View

| Capability | Host | Student |
|---|---|---|
| Launch polls | Yes | No (receives and answers) |
| Start trivia game | Yes | No (receives and plays) |
| Control AI anchor | Yes (start/stop/analyze now) | No (receives updates) |
| Topic timeline | Yes (read-only) | Yes (read-only) |
| Glossary | Yes (read-only) | Yes (searchable) |
| Bookmark confused moments | No | Yes |
| Post-class recovery pack | No | Yes |
| View poll/trivia results | Yes (aggregate) | Yes (own results) |

The host acts as the **source of truth** for all shared state. The host's app maintains the canonical state and broadcasts updates to all students via the Zoom SDK's `sendMessage` / `onMessage` API. Students never send data to each other directly.

## Architecture

```
Zoom Desktop Client
  +-- Side Panel (Embedded Browser)
        +-- React App
              +-- Host? -> HostDashboard
              +-- Student? -> StudentView

Both connect to:
  Express Backend (localhost:3001, or EC2)
    +-- /api/auth       -> Zoom OAuth PKCE
    +-- /api/ai         -> AI endpoints (poll, quiz, topic, recovery, cues)
    +-- /api/transcript  -> Transcript storage + rolling buffer
    +-- /api/bookmarks   -> Bookmark CRUD
    +-- /api/rtms        -> RTMS webhook + stream client

  AI Provider (AWS Bedrock — Llama 3 70B via Converse API)
  SQLite Database (via Prisma ORM)
```

### Message Protocol

All real-time communication uses the Zoom SDK's `sendMessage` / `onMessage`:

| Message | Sender | Receiver | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POLL_START` | Host | Students | Launch a poll |
| `POLL_RESPONSE` | Student | Host | Submit poll answer |
| `POLL_RESULTS` | Host | Students | Broadcast results |
| `ARENA_START` | Host | Students | Begin trivia |
| `ARENA_QUESTION` | Host | Students | Send next question |
| `ARENA_ANSWER` | Student | Host | Submit trivia answer |
| `ARENA_LEADERBOARD` | Host | Students | Show scores |
| `ARENA_END` | Host | Students | Final standings |
| `TOPIC_UPDATE` | Host | Students | New/updated topic |
| `GLOSSARY_UPDATE` | Host | Students | New terms |
| `FULL_STATE` | Host | Students | Late-joiner sync |
| `REQUEST_STATE` | Student | Host | Request full state |

---

## Deployment

The app runs on an **EC2 instance** with a static ngrok tunnel for development.

### Zoom Marketplace Configuration

The Zoom App is registered and configured on [marketplace.zoom.us](https://marketplace.zoom.us):

- **Home URL:** `https://your-tunnel.ngrok-free.dev`
- **Redirect URL:** `https://your-tunnel.ngrok-free.dev/api/auth/callback`
- **Webhook URL:** `https://your-tunnel.ngrok-free.dev/api/rtms/webhook`
- **RTMS:** Enabled (1-year trial through Feb 2027)
- **OAuth Scopes:** `zoomapp:inmeeting`, `meeting:read:meeting`, `user:read`

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID` | From Zoom Marketplace app |
| `ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET` | From Zoom Marketplace app |
| `ZOOM_REDIRECT_URL` | OAuth callback URL (must match Marketplace) |
| `ZOOM_SECRET_TOKEN` | For RTMS webhook HMAC verification |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Random secret for express-session |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `file:./dev.db` (SQLite) or PostgreSQL connection string |
| `AWS_REGION` | AWS region for Bedrock (`us-east-1`) |
| `PORT` | Server port (default: 3001) |
| `CLIENT_URL` | Frontend URL (default: `http://localhost:5173`) |

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+

### Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in credentials (see Environment Variables above)

# 3. Copy env to server directory (server reads from its own cwd)
cp .env server/.env

# 4. Initialize the database
cd server && npx prisma migrate dev --name init && cd ..

# 5. Start development servers
npm run dev
```

### Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start client (5173) + server (3001) |
| `npm run dev:mock` | Same + mock transcript service |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run db:migrate -w server` | Run Prisma migrations |
| `npm run db:studio -w server` | Open Prisma Studio |

### DevPreview (Browser Testing)

When accessed outside of Zoom, the app renders a **DevPreview** that simulates both Host and Student views. This lets you test UI flows without a Zoom meeting:

- Host/Student view toggle
- All feature tabs (Pulse, Arena, Anchor)
- Real AI integration for poll/quiz/recovery generation
- End Class flow with Recovery Pack
